# Qualification work
The idea for this project was simple. Help people start running by making a gamified version of popular running apps. I checked what was in most other running apps and added it to my own, for example map view, running history, stats. Using the same information I tried to gamify it by adding coins that you can earn just by running or completing weekly tasks (how often, or how far) the tasks would depend on the users performance by making it just a bit harder than the user is used to and getting them to progress. The coins would then be used to purchase customization items for the character every user has.

## What I learned
I learned to use a new programming language, flutter, to make mobile apps and how it interacts with the GraphQL API. At the moment it was very hard because some of the things that were simple in React were a lot harder in flutter. At the time there was no easy way to make network requests and a lot of time went into making it work.
